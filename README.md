phpseclib-jsbn-rsa
==================

An example on how to use the [jsbn](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/) javascript library to encrypt data using RSA and decrypt it in PHP using [phpseclib](http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net).

To generate a new key pair load 'generate.php'. Next copy/paste the private key that is displayed into 'index.php' (you can't miss what needs to be replaced).
